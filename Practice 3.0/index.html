                  I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                  were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                  honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                  "I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
                  I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some
                  people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the
                  free Intro course and found it Incredibly fun! I enrolled
                  shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                  grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer
                  at a VR startup."

                  "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of
                  code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help
                  me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                  by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
                  things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
                  not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
                  walt long for assistance. The agile team project, In
                  particular, was outstanding.!"
